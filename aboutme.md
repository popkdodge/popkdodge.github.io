My name is Noah Povis, a data scientist with a focus on helping Venture Capital and tech startups make better informed decisions and make sense of the vast (or limited) amounts of data they are working with to in order to build the next Unicorn. My past experiences in entrepreneurship, traveling, and time spent at Penn State studying business has made me realize how much understanding patterns can amplify your ability to interact with the world. My goal as a Data Scientist is to help discover those patterns and use them not as a means to an end, but as a way to ask the right questions such as: 
- Are these the right people for this type of solution?
- Are we focusing on the right problem?
- How can we position ourselves to be more antifragile to externalities?

I have come to realize that life isn't about finding the answer to things, but rather finding the right questions to dig deeper into what is really important.
