The number of shares outstanding is all the shares of a company stock that is purschest and held by the company's investors.

#### Summary of airlines Market Cap.

Among its competitors Delta airlines lead the pack and is consitently leading its main competitor Southwest.  Eversince the first quarter of 2018 Delta have lead against Southwest Airlines.  The most recent quarter shows a significant market cap reduction and Southwest Airines is slightly leading.  I believe this is a sign that Delta is more "oversold" compares to its competitors and would be a better bargian than Southwest.  United Airlines sit at the middle of the pack in market cap in the past 10 quarters and fell toward the bottom of the pack toward American airlines this recent quarter.

**P/E Ratio** is a measure of the relationship between a company's stock price and its earning per share of stocks inssue.  Generally a high P/E ratio indicates that investors expect higher earning but does not mean that is a better investment.  A high P/E ratio could indicated a 'overvalued' stock and vice versa.

#### Summary of airlines P/E ratio

Among its competitors Delta alirlines tend to stablize at a certian P/E ratio. Stock that have a consistent P/E ratio is less unpredictable and won't change too much with volatility. Delta, Southwest, and United all have a pretty consistent trend of P/E ratio with Southwest showing a slow increase of P/E ratio overtime.  From a P/E ratio perspective Southwest Airlines is the best among the airlines companies. What is interesting, is that American airlines have a very volitile P/E ratio where it show extreemly high peak at a P/E ratio of 34 and bottom at a P/E ratio of -6.

**Note:** AAL D/E ratio is very erratics compares to its competitors and skewing the charts I suggest to use the legend and click out the AAL bar and AAL lines.

**Debt to Equity** evaluate a company's financial leverage. Higher the D/E ratio equate to a higher risk company.   D/E ratio is calculate by a company's Total Liability divide by the Total Shareholder's Equity.  Liability usualy consist of Loans ammounts and Shareholder's Equity is Total Liability minus All of a companies assets such as material, income, ect.

#### Summary of airlines D/E ratio.

Over periods of time Delta, United, and Southwest have maintain a consistant ammount of D/E ratio. Delta D/E ratio ranges between 3.5 to 3.8. United airlines ranges 3.5 to 4.6. Southwest appear to be the best companies in term of leveraged health with only a 1.6 to 1.7 D/E ranges. **Notice** American Airlines have a huge negitive D/E ratio meaning that its liabilities exceed its assets throwing Its D/E ratio at a very volitle range of a 381 to -2817. American Airline have consistantly have a negitive D/E ratio meaning the companies operate at very risky territory.

**Free Cash Flow** is the ammount of cash that is left over after a company pay off its expenses and capital expenditure.  Free cash flow or FCF help measure a company effiencies at generating cash.  A high free cash flow can be use to pay investors dividens, expand operations or deleverage AKA. paying off debt.  A high and increasing FCF is a good sign.

#### Summary of airlines FCF

Airlines companies as a whole follw a very cylicals pattern of Free Cash Flow. The cylicals patterns of FCF tend to Bottoms around the winter months and peaks during the summer months. The COVID-19 pandemic greatly effect this cylical patterns and causing the rebound of airlines FCF to not be as apparent. Every companies is greatly effected by the pandemic.

# Conclusions

Delta airlines and Southwest airlines are the two companies I would invest in for long-term purpose. They both lead the pack in the fundamental stock matrics.  Although I first belive that Delta would be the best airlines stock to invest I would admit that Southwest airlines could be an edge better.
