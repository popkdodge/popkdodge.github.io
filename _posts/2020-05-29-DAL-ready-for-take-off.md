The COVID-19 pandemic has cause significant financial impact on the airlines industries. Whitch one of the major airlines is most at risk of bankrupcies?  In the past three months majors airlines stock plunge and loss 30-60% of its value. As shutdown come to a close investors look toward major airlines companies for a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy in to Airlines royalites such as Delta ([NYSE:DAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DAL/)), Southwest Airlines([NYSE:LUV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LUV/)), American Airlines ([NASDAQ: AAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAL/)), and United Airlines ([NASDAQ:UAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UAL/)).  I think the Delta is the best choice amongs them.
