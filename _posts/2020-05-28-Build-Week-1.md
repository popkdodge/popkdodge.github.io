## What is so special about Venture Capital? 

Venture Capital is a type of institutional investor that provides capital to startup companies and small businesses that are believed to have long-term growth potential. Essentially, these firms are known for taking big bets on small businesses in hopes that they will one day return 100x of their initial investment. Although the chances of that happening are very low, a VC firm really only needs a small percentage of their investments to bare fruit to mitigate all the downside. A few big names that took off with the help of VC money: APPLE, GOOGLE, STARBUCKS, UBER, LYFT, SLACK, and the list could go on forever. These VC's really help founders drive innovation with the resources they provide. Therefore, I deemed it important to find out how some of the TOP VC's in the US have been doing over the past 5 years and to see if I could spot any trends. 

## How I determined which VC's to sample for this exploratory analysis? 

Foremost, all the datasets I used for this post I gathered through Crunchbase's extensive inventory. There are around 50,000 VC's registered on Crunchbase's site and trying to compare them all would just be a pain when it is typically a handful of prominent VC's who invest in the majority of hot startups. Therefore, I filtered for VC's that had at least 100 exits. An exit is when a company in a VC's portfolio is acquired or IPO's. Only in those instances are the VC's able to make a sizable return (remember everytime a VC invests in a company they want 100x or die). Out of the 50,000 VC's listed I got a return of about 40 VC's that all looked fairly familiar. However, I wanted to break this down further and filter the top 10 because VC's often make a large amount of investments a year and still it is mainly a small percentage that get in on the deals that really take off. Therefore, I decided to rank the top 40 VC's according to their win percentage(Exit/Investment Ratio). I made sure to standardized this ratio in order to account for a VC that invested in a 3x the number of their fellow VC's but still returned about the same number of Exits and vice versa. The bar plot below shows my results.

For someone who spends most of their free time scrolling 'VC Twitter'(term used to coin conversation bubbles within the Twitter platform), I was really surprised to not see some of the most active VC's(on twitter and other new sources) on there: Y Combinator(also an accelerator), TechStars, A16z, ontop of the fact I didn't recognize half of these names. 

## What Industries Were Most Heavily Invested In

Now that I had a small list of VC's to filter through I wanted to know what industries they were most heavily investing in. I was able to narrow that down easily by determining the frequency of each industry labeled in every investment amongst these VCs. In addition, I filtered for early stage investments (Angel, Pre-Seed, Seed, Series A, Series B) because this is these are the most popular stages to invest and typically the most publicized nowadays by the likes of Techcrunch and friends.

Unfortunately, my key takeaway from this is that AI and software are going to replace humans faster than I thought if these top VC's keep pouring money into them like a waterfall (JKJK). There was relatively no surprises with this bar plot besides the fact that Mobile investments were ranked last with only 42 investments. I personally see mobile devices replacing laptops and desktops because they are more easily accessible, distributable, and require less energy so people around the world regardless of living conditions can access the internet. I know Softbank (another VC firm not based in the US) is betting big on Mobile. 

## Where are these investments taking place

I am a firm believer of the saying, 'You become a product of your environment'. The graph above is a clear representation of that as is tweet from our founding father

Now, what this graph and Austen are saying is that if you want to increase your chances of working/starting a successful startup you need to be willing to sleep in your car. Silicon Valley (the denses area of fuchsia bubbles) companies received more funding rounds than the next 6 cities combined! I don't believe Zoom or Slack can replicate the type of magic that is felt in Silicon Valley when you have a combination of young/brilliant individuals, big risk takers, and people with deep pockets all standing in line at the same coffee spot. It will definitely be interesting to see how Covid affects these numbers over the coming years.
